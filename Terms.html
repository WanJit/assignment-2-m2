<h1>Details of The Competition</h1>
<p>The competition aims to benchmark the sclera segmentation task with a common dataset. <br>
This database consists of 2624 RGB images taken from 82 identities and images were collected from both eyes so 164 different eye. <br>
Here for each individual image in four multi-angles (looking straight, left, right and up) is considered. For each angle 4 images are considered. <br>
The individual comprise of both male and female and different colour, few of them were wearing contact lens and images were taken in the different time in the day. <br>
The database contains images with blinking eyes, closed eye and blurred eye images. High resolution images are provided in the database (300 dpi resolution and 7500 x 5000 dimensions). <br>
All the images are in JPEG format. A NIKON D 800 camera and 28300 lenses were used for image capturing. A ground truth or manual sclera segmentation of this dataset is prepared. <br>
For development purposes, a subset of the database, both eye images and ground truth (1 image for each angle of first 30 individuals i.e 120) will be provided to the participants. <br>
The proposed algorithm of the participants will be evaluated by the organizer. The evaluation measure will be the precision and recall (recall will be consider the prior measure for ranking the algorithms).<br>
The algorithm that the participates will submit must not take more than 10 seconds to segment and generate a mask for a image in Intel core i7 processor
